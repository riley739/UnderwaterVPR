# VPR-methods-evaluation
This repo allows you to easily test almost any SOTA VPR model within a minute.
The architecture code and weights are from the respective authors of the papers, ensuring reliability.

## Basic use on an unlabelled dataset

Simply run this to try a method on a (unlabelled) toy dataset contained in assets. This is super lightweight and will take a few seconds even running on a CPU of a laptop.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/gmberton/VPR-methods-evaluation
cd VPR-methods-evaluation
python3 main.py --method=cosplace --backbone=ResNet18 --descriptors_dimension=512 \
    --database_folder=toy_dataset/database --queries_folder=toy_dataset/queries \
    --no_labels --image_size 200 200 --num_preds_to_save 3 \
    --log_dir toy_experiment
```

which will generate images like this within the `logs/toy_experiment` visual predictions for each query like this one

</p>

You can also use this on your own dataset (or any two directories) simply changing the paths parameters.

## Basic use on a labelled dataset

The code is designed to be readily used with our [VPR-datasets-downloader](https://github.com/gmberton/VPR-datasets-downloader) repo, so that using a few simple commands you can download a dataset and test any model on it. The VPR-datasets-downloader code allows you to download multiple VPR datasets that are automatically formatted in the same format as used by this repo.

The format needed by this repo to compute recalls is that each image should use as filename `path/to/image/@UTM_east@UTM_north@whatever@.jpg`

```
mkdir VPR-codebase
cd VPR-codebase

git clone https://github.com/gmberton/VPR-datasets-downloader
cd VPR-datasets-downloader
python3 download_st_lucia.py

cd ..

git clone --recursive https://github.com/gmberton/VPR-methods-evaluation
cd VPR-methods-evaluation
python3 main.py --method=cosplace --backbone=ResNet18 --descriptors_dimension=512 \
    --database_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/database \
    --queries_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/queries
```
This should produce this as output `R@1: 98.8, R@5: 99.7, R@10: 99.9, R@20: 100.0`, which will be saved in a log file under `./logs/`

You can easily change the paths for different datasets, and you can use any supported method.
Note that each method has weights only for certain architectures. For example NetVLAD only has weights for VGG16 with descriptors_dimension 32768 and 4069 (with PCA).

NB: make sure to use the `git clone --recursive`, otherwise some third party (like AP-GeM) models can't be used.


### Visualize predictions

Predictions can be easily visualized through the `num_preds_to_save` parameter. For example running this

```
python3 main.py --method=cosplace --backbone=ResNet18 --descriptors_dimension=512 \
    --num_preds_to_save=3 --log_dir=cosplace_on_stlucia \
    --database_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/database \
    --queries_folder=../VPR-datasets-downloader/datasets/st_lucia/images/test/queries
```
will generate under the path `./logs/cosplace_on_stlucia/*/preds` images such as

<p float="left">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gmberton/VPR-methods-evaluation/master/images/pred.jpg"  height="200"/>
</p>

Given that saving predictions for each query might take long, you can also pass the parameter `--save_only_wrong_preds` which will save only predictions for wrongly predicted queries (i.e. where the first prediction is wrong).

## Supported models
NetVLAD, AP-GeM, SFRS, CosPlace, Conv-AP, MixVPR, EigenPlaces, AnyLoc, SALAD, EigenPlaces-indoor, SALAD-indoor, CricaVPR, CliqueMining, MegaLoc.

### Unsupported models / contributing
There are some models that we tried to add but couldn't get to work, mostly due to issues in their codebases, namely VLAD-BuFF, Bag-of-Queries, DINO-Mix.
We'd gladly accept PRs from anyone who can get them to work.

To get a model to work simply add it to `parser.py` and add it to `vpr_models/__init__.py`: if the model is easy to download (e.g. through `torch.hub.load`), adding a few (4-5) lines of code should be enough to make it work. There is no need to test it on a VPR dataset, just make it run on the toy dataset and then we'll test it on the VPR datasets ourselves to ensure correctness.
