CLS TOKENS BUT ALSO FEATURES
COULD MAYBE HAVE CLS PROVIDE NODE EMBEDDING AND FEATURES PROVIDE SOME MEAUSRE OF EDGE LINKS AND FEATURES ?? 
other pooling methods hmm could be interesting?




TODO:
    - get working
    - test works with loading and saving original dataset
    - test with the graph neural net
    - test own dataset


READ PAPERS
Relook at the thesis' for ideas..

IMPROVE BOW APPROACH AND GET IT WORKING
maybe implement it using C++ ?? 

Write notes and look into applying other methods...


GEt DBOW2 working with orb features using vocab 
generate the words and then use that as input into graph network
see how this goes and then can get better network architecutre if needed. 


RUN with these settings then add the extra visual words and samples and see how it goes
